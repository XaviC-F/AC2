  "content": "<p>Harvey Weinstein's victims knew they weren't alone, but each woman feared going public without others. The first to speak out faced the full weight of his power and disbelief.</p>\n\n<h2>The Isolation Problem</h2>\n<p>Victims of abuse often know they're not alone, but fear the consequences of speaking out individually. The first person to come forward faces disbelief, legal threats, and social isolation, while the abuser uses their power to silence and discredit them.</p>\n\n<h2>Coordinated Disclosure</h2>\n<p>Anonymous credible commitments allow victims to commit to coming forward, setting their own threshold for when they're willing to be revealed. One victim might set their threshold at 5 commitments, while another might need 20. When enough victims have committed, everyone who set a threshold below that number is revealed together.</p>\n\n<h2>Strength in Unity</h2>\n<p>This approach ensures that victims are never alone when they speak out. By coordinating their disclosure, victims can overcome the power imbalance that keeps abuse hidden, transforming individual fear into collective courage.</p>"
