Without this certainty, individuals risk retaliation while the effort fails.</p>\n\n<h2>The Challenge</h2>\n<p>Labor organizing faces a fundamental coordination problem. Workers want to unionize, but each individual fears being the only one to take action. Companies have powerful incentives to prevent unionization and can target early organizers with retaliation, making it dangerous to be the first to commit publicly.</p>\n\n<h2>How Anonymous Credible Commitments Help</h2>\n<p>With AC2, workers can commit to unionization privately, setting their own threshold for when they're willing to be revealed. A warehouse worker might set their threshold at 1,000 commitments, while a delivery driver might need 5,000. When enough workers have committed, everyone who set a threshold below that number is revealed simultaneously.</p>\n\n<h2>The Power of Collective Action</h2>\n<p>This transforms unionization from a risky individual decision into a coordinated collective action. Workers know that if they commit, they'll only be revealed when enough others have also committed, providing the safety in numbers that makes organizing possible.</p>"
