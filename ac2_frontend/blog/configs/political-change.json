Fear of being the only dissenter keeps everyone silent.</p>\n\n<h2>The Silence Problem</h2>\n<p>In authoritarian regimes, expressing dissent is dangerous. Individuals who speak out alone face severe consequences, while the regime benefits from the perception that opposition is minimal. This creates a coordination trap where everyone wants change but no one acts.</p>\n\n<h2>Breaking the Silence</h2>\n<p>Anonymous credible commitments allow citizens to express their opposition privately, committing to public action only when enough others have also committed. A student might set their threshold at 10,000 commitments, while a journalist might need 50,000. When the threshold is reached, all committed individuals are revealed together.</p>\n\n<h2>Safety in Numbers</h2>\n<p>This approach provides the safety in numbers that makes political change possible. Citizens can coordinate their opposition without exposing themselves to individual risk, transforming silent discontent into visible collective action.</p>"
