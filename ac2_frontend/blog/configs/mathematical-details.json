  "content": "<p>This document provides a formal mathematical treatment of the anonymous credible commitment scheme used in AC2.</p>\n\n<h2>Preliminaries</h2>\n\n<p>Let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n\\}$ be a set of $n$ users. Each user $u_i$ selects a threshold $k_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ representing the minimum number of total commitments required before they are willing to be revealed.</p>\n\n<h2>Commitment Scheme</h2>\n\n<p>Each user $u_i$ generates a commitment $C_i$ using a cryptographically secure commitment scheme. The commitment satisfies the following properties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Hiding:</strong> $C_i$ reveals no information about the user's identity or threshold $k_i$ until revelation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Binding:</strong> Once $C_i$ is published, $u_i$ cannot change their commitment or threshold.</li>\n  <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Upon revelation, anyone can verify that $C_i$ corresponds to $u_i$ and $k_i$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Threshold Revelation</h2>\n\n<p>Let $N(t)$ denote the total number of commitments at time $t$. User $u_i$ is revealed when:</p>\n\n<p>$$N(t) \\geq k_i$$</p>\n\n<p>All users with $k_i \\leq N(t)$ are revealed simultaneously, creating a cascading revelation effect.</p>\n\n<h2>Security Properties</h2>\n\n<p>The scheme guarantees:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Until $N(t) \\geq k_i$, user $u_i$ remains anonymous with probability $1 - \\epsilon$ for negligible $\\epsilon$.</li>\n  <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Each commitment $C_i$ provides cryptographic proof that $u_i$ has committed to threshold $k_i$.</li>\n  <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Once revealed, $u_i$ cannot deny their commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Formal Proof Sketch</h2>\n\n<p>The security of the scheme relies on the computational hardness of the underlying cryptographic primitives. We assume:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Discrete logarithm problem is hard in the chosen group $\\mathbb{G}$</li>\n  <li>Hash function $H$ is collision-resistant</li>\n  <li>Commitment scheme is computationally binding and hiding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Under these assumptions, we can prove that the scheme satisfies the security properties listed above. The full proof is omitted here but follows standard cryptographic reduction techniques.</p>"
