<h2>The Mathematics behind Anonymous Credible Commitments</h2>
<p>This document provides a formal mathematical treatment of the anonymous credible commitment scheme used in AC2.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Let $\mathcal{U} = \{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ be a set of $n$ users. Each user $u_i$ selects a threshold $k_i \in \mathbb{N}$ representing the minimum number of total commitments required before they are willing to be revealed. Let there be a set of coefficients $\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_N\}$ where $N$ is the maximum threshold we are expecting to be set. This is a fundamental restriction of this scheme and cannot be changed once it has been set. These coefficients correspond to a set of polynomials $F_i$ defined in the following way:</p>

<p>$$\begin{aligned} F_0 &= c_0 \\ F_1 &= c_0 + c_{1}x \\ F_2 &= c_0 + c_{1}x + c_{2}x^{2} \\ &\quad\vdots \\ F_n &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i x^i \end{aligned}$$</p>

<h2>Commitment Scheme</h2>
<p>Each user $u_i$ generates a commitment $C_i$ using a cryptographically secure commitment scheme. The commitment satisfies the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hiding:</strong> $C_i$ reveals no information about the user's identity or threshold $k_i$ until revelation.</li>
  <li><strong>Binding:</strong> Once $C_i$ is published, $u_i$ cannot change their commitment or threshold.</li>
  <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Upon revelation, anyone can verify that $C_i$ corresponds to $u_i$ and $k_i$.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Threshold Revelation</h2>
<p>Let $N(t)$ denote the total number of commitments at time $t$. User $u_i$ is revealed when:</p>

<p>$$N(t) \geq k_i$$</p>

<p>All users with $k_i \leq N(t)$ are revealed simultaneously, creating a cascading revelation effect.</p>

<h2>Security Properties</h2>
<p>The scheme guarantees:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Until $N(t) \geq k_i$, user $u_i$ remains anonymous with probability $1 - \epsilon$ for negligible $\epsilon$.</li>
  <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Each commitment $C_i$ provides cryptographic proof that $u_i$ has committed to threshold $k_i$.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Once revealed, $u_i$ cannot deny their commitment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formal Proof Sketch</h2>
<p>The security of the scheme relies on the computational hardness of the underlying cryptographic primitives. We assume:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discrete logarithm problem is hard in the chosen group $\mathbb{G}$</li>
  <li>Hash function $H$ is collision-resistant</li>
  <li>Commitment scheme is computationally binding and hiding</li>
</ul>

<p>Under these assumptions, we can prove that the scheme satisfies the security properties listed above. The full proof is omitted here but follows standard cryptographic reduction techniques.</p>
