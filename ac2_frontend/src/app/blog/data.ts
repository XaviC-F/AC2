    "title": "Political Dissent And Engineering Change",
    "date": "November 23, 2025",
    "excerpt": "Citizens in an authoritarian regime oppose the government but won't speak out unless they know the majority shares their views. Fear of being the only dissenter keeps everyone silent.",
    "description": "How anonymous credible commitments can help citizens and politians coordinate their efforts to bring about change, despite power structures which seek to suppress dissent.",
    "content": "<h2>Political Repressors Are Organised</h2><p>Citizens in an authoritarian regime who oppose the government and the political system in which they reside are often subject to surveilance, violence, and even murder. They are unable to speak out without risking their lives and the welfare of their families, creating a powerful incentive to stay quiet and avoid disrupting the political order.</p>\n\n<h2>Infectiousness of Silence</h2>\n<p>Individuals who speak alone face severe consequences. Because of this, no-one will speak out first without being sure that others will join them. This silence spreads like a disease, as dissidents are unable to see how many of their fellow citizens are also opposed to the government and the political system which dominates their lives. If people will only speak out with certainty that others will join them, but constant expressions of love for the regime are required by law, then the common certainty that the regie should fall can never be established across a population.</p>\n\n<h2>Enforced Uniformity In Governments</h2>\n<p>A similar effect also occurs in governments, where the leaders of political parties and other institutions may seek to pass policies which the majority of lawmakers do not want to vote for. The presence of <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/whips/\">whips</a> in parliamentary democracies are a method of allowing senior memors of the government to make lower-ranking law makers fall into line, even if the majority of them do not want to vote for a particular law or resolution. This worsens the ability of the government to represent the voters, and potentially introduces incentives which worsen the centralisation of power against the wishes of the citizens of a nation</p>\n\n<h2>AC2 and Safety In Numbers</h2>\n<p>Anonymous Credible Commitments (AC2) allow citizens, law makers, and members of other dissenting groups to coordinate against their repressors. Both political repression of citizens and the coersive control of lawmakers work through the improved coordination of the repressors over the repressed. With AC2, we can level the playing field.</p>"

    "date": "November 23, 2025",
    "excerpt": "Harvey Weinstein's victims knew they weren't alone, but each woman feared going public without others. The first to speak out faced the full weight of his power and disbelief.",
    "description": "Victims of abuse, whistleblowers, and other groups who wish to expose wrongdoing often face disbelief, isolation, and legal threats. Anonymous credible commitments can help them coordinate their efforts to expose wrongdoing.",
    "content": "<h2>Whistleblowers Are Isolated</h2><p>Oftentimes, whistleblowers are part of a small group who are aware of wrongdoing. Each of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_cases\">Harvey Weinstein's victims</a>, for example, knew they were not alone but were afraid to be the first to speak out due to fear of reprisals from the powerful individuals they were exposing.</p>\n\n<h2>Collective Statements and Disbelief</h2>\n<p>Whistleblower reports are often not believed when they are first stated. The papers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23123964\">leaked by Edward Snowden</a> were denied for some time, before the US government finally admitted to their broad spying program targeting their own citizens as well as the citizens of other countries. Early Weinstein victims were not believed due to his good reputation in Hollywood and strong connections within media organisations reporting on the matter. What pushed the reports from isolated allegations to successful criminal prosecutions wasn't the evidence which could be produced by a single individual, but by the breadth and consistency of reports made by many people. When one person makes an allegation, they can be dismissed. When many people make that allegation collectively, they are much harder to ignore.</p>\n\n<h2>Strength in Unity</h2>\n<p>Anonymous credible commitments allow victims and whistleblowers alike to come forward together, setting their threshold for when they are happy for their story to be revealed to the public. When enough victims, troubled employees, or other parties with sensitive information they want to share have committed to the cause in question, they can reveal their commitments and stories together with voices which are much harder for the powerful to silence.</p>"

    "description": "Frontier AI labs have been racing to develop powerful AI models, and have publicly stated that development should be paused until we can guarantee their safety.",
    "content": "<h2>Racing For Powerful AI</h2><p>Companies developing advanced AI models are now some of the most <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-hits-500-billion-valuation-after-share-sale-source-says-2025-10-02/\">valuable on the planet</a>. They are building a world-changing technology which, by the admission of some of the people who have founded these AI companies, have the potential to cause <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-warning-of-ai-potential-dangers-60-minutes-transcript/\">immense harm to humans</a> and potentially end the world as we know it. So if this is so dangerous, how do they justify continuing to build this?</p>\n\n<h2>No-one Can Stop Unless Everyone Stops</h2>\n<p>They claim that thye cannot stop unless everyone stops. We are locked in a race, the race to create a machine smarter than a human, and whoever can do that first gets to decide how it is built and what it does to the humans it leaves behind. These tech CEOs and investors say that we are in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/07/28/the-race-for-ai-supremacy-a-new-frontier-of-international-competition/\">race to build superintelligence</a> and that it would be irresponsible to pause unless everyone else did so as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Credibly Committing To A Pause</h2>\n<p>Using AC2, we can allow these AI labs to credibly commit to a pause even without publicly stating that they have made this commitment. A legally binding treaty can be put together, such that all of the AI labs guarantee that they will not release any more powerful models for a year, if the other labs also agree to this. Labs can then sign up to this without publishing that they have done so, reducing the chance that they get investment restrictions and issues hiring, with the agreement coming into effect when enough labs anonymously sign up.</p>\n\n<h2>Building Responsible Regulation</h2>\n<p>Allowing industries to self-regulate in this manner, halting their activities when their own technology cannot be made safe without further research, lets us combine the speed of private industry with the responsibility of collective action.</p>"

    "description": "How anonymous credible commitments can help workers coordinate unionization efforts without exposing individuals to retaliation.",
    "content": "<h2>Amazon Workers Want Change</h2><p>Amazon workers want to unionise. However, they also know that if they are the first to act towards the creation of a union and others do not jump to join them, they will face reprisals. These range from termination of employment to being the target of lawfare, effectively baring efforts to coordinate one of the world's largest workforces.</p>\n\n<h2>How Anonymous Credible Commitments Help</h2>\n<p>With AC2, workers can commit to joining a union privately, registering their commitment in an irreversible but also entirely encrypted way. Once enough of their colleagues also sign up to this commitment, their identity along with their desire for form a union is made publicly available, giving them a credible reason to follow through with their claim.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and Social Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>AC2 is designed to function in a legal and social infrastructure which incentivises people to follow through with commitments once they have been made public. This can occur through social mechanisms, such as a broad expectation that you follow your word, or through legal mechanisms, such as a law firm ready for file for the creation of a union with your name attached the moment your name becomes public. This protocol does not replace this societal organisation, it augments it to allow these coordination mechanisms to function even when there is fear of being the first person to move.</p>\n\n<h2>The Power of Collective Action</h2>\n<p>This transforms unionisation from a long series of risky individual actions into a coordinated finding of consensus. Rather than efforts being permanently held back by Amazon's power to intimidate individual workers, they can collectively reveal their desires at a single moment, creating a force their employer cannot ignore.</p>"

    "date": "November 21, 2025",
    "excerpt": "A detailed mathematical treatment of the cryptographic scheme underlying anonymous credible commitments, including formal definitions, security properties, and proofs.",
    "description": "Mathematical foundations and cryptographic guarantees of the AC2 system, with ID verification and decentralised decryption.",
    "content": "<!-- Edit this HTML file directly to update the mathematical-details blog post -->\n\n<h2>The Mathematics behind Anonymous Credible Commitments</h2>\n<p>This document provides a formal mathematical treatment of the anonymous credible commitment scheme used in AC2.</p>\n\n<h2>Preliminaries</h2>\n<p>Let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n\\}$ be a set of $n$ users. Each user $u_i$ selects a threshold $k_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ representing the minimum number of total commitments required before they are willing to be revealed. Let there be a set of coefficients $\\mathcal{C} = \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_N\\}$ where $N$ is the maximum threshold we are expecting to be set. This is a fundamental restriction of this scheme and cannot be changed once it has been set. These coefficients correspond to a set of polynomials $F_i$ defined in the following way:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\begin{aligned} F_0 &= c_0 \\\\ F_1 &= c_0 + c_{1}x \\\\ F_2 &= c_0 + c_{1}x + c_{2}x^{2} \\\\ &\\quad\\vdots \\\\ F_n &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i x^i \\end{aligned}$$</p>\n\n<h2>Commitment Scheme</h2>\n<p>Each user $u_i$ generates a commitment $C_i$ using a cryptographically secure commitment scheme. The commitment satisfies the following properties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Hiding:</strong> $C_i$ reveals no information about the user's identity or threshold $k_i$ until revelation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Binding:</strong> Once $C_i$ is published, $u_i$ cannot change their commitment or threshold.</li>\n  <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Upon revelation, anyone can verify that $C_i$ corresponds to $u_i$ and $k_i$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Threshold Revelation</h2>\n<p>Let $N(t)$ denote the total number of commitments at time $t$. User $u_i$ is revealed when:</p>\n\n<p>$$N(t) \\geq k_i$$</p>\n\n<p>All users with $k_i \\leq N(t)$ are revealed simultaneously, creating a cascading revelation effect.</p>\n\n<h2>Security Properties</h2>\n<p>The scheme guarantees:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Until $N(t) \\geq k_i$, user $u_i$ remains anonymous with probability $1 - \\epsilon$ for negligible $\\epsilon$.</li>\n  <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Each commitment $C_i$ provides cryptographic proof that $u_i$ has committed to threshold $k_i$.</li>\n  <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Once revealed, $u_i$ cannot deny their commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Formal Proof Sketch</h2>\n<p>The security of the scheme relies on the computational hardness of the underlying cryptographic primitives. We assume:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Discrete logarithm problem is hard in the chosen group $\\mathbb{G}$</li>\n  <li>Hash function $H$ is collision-resistant</li>\n  <li>Commitment scheme is computationally binding and hiding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Under these assumptions, we can prove that the scheme satisfies the security properties listed above. The full proof is omitted here but follows standard cryptographic reduction techniques.</p>\n\n",
