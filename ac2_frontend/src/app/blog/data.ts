    "content": "<h2>Amazon Workers Want Change</h2><p>Amazon workers want to unionise. However, they also know that if they are the first to act towards the creation of a union and others do not jump to join them, they will face reprisals. These range from termination of employment to being the target of lawfare, effectively baring efforts to coordinate one of the world's largest workforces.</p>\n\n<h2>How Anonymous Credible Commitments Help</h2>\n<p>With AC2, workers can commit to joining a union privately, registering their commitment in an irreversible but also entirely encrypted way. Once enough of their colleagues also sign up to this commitment, their identity along with their desire for form a union is made publicly available, giving them a credible reason to follow through with their claim.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and Social Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>AC2 is designed to function in a legal and social infrastructure which incentivises people to follow through with commitments once they have been made public. This can occur through social mechanisms, such as a broad expectation that you follow your word, or through legal mechanisms, such as a law firm ready for file for the creation of a union with your name attached the moment your name becomes public. This protocol does not replace this societal organisation, it augments it to allow these coordination mechanisms to function even when there is fear of being the first person to move.</p>\n\n<h2>The Power of Collective Action</h2>\n<p>This transforms unionisation from a long series of risky individual actions into a coordinated finding of consensus. Rather than efforts being permanently held back by Amazon's power to intimidate individual workers, they can collectively reveal their desires at a single moment, creating a force their employer cannot ignore.</p>"

    "excerpt": "A detailed mathematical treatment of the cryptographic scheme underlying anonymous credible commitments, including formal definitions, security properties, and proofs.",
    "description": "Mathematical foundations and cryptographic guarantees of the AC2 system, with formal proofs and detailed explanations.",
    "content": "<p>This document provides a formal mathematical treatment of the anonymous credible commitment scheme used in AC2.</p>\n\n<h2>Preliminaries</h2>\n\n<p>Let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n\\}$ be a set of $n$ users. Each user $u_i$ selects a threshold $k_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ representing the minimum number of total commitments required before they are willing to be revealed.</p>\n\n<h2>Commitment Scheme</h2>\n\n<p>Each user $u_i$ generates a commitment $C_i$ using a cryptographically secure commitment scheme. The commitment satisfies the following properties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Hiding:</strong> $C_i$ reveals no information about the user's identity or threshold $k_i$ until revelation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Binding:</strong> Once $C_i$ is published, $u_i$ cannot change their commitment or threshold.</li>\n  <li><strong>Verifiable:</strong> Upon revelation, anyone can verify that $C_i$ corresponds to $u_i$ and $k_i$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Threshold Revelation</h2>\n\n<p>Let $N(t)$ denote the total number of commitments at time $t$. User $u_i$ is revealed when:</p>\n\n<p>$$N(t) \\geq k_i$$</p>\n\n<p>All users with $k_i \\leq N(t)$ are revealed simultaneously, creating a cascading revelation effect.</p>\n\n<h2>Security Properties</h2>\n\n<p>The scheme guarantees:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Until $N(t) \\geq k_i$, user $u_i$ remains anonymous with probability $1 - \\epsilon$ for negligible $\\epsilon$.</li>\n  <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Each commitment $C_i$ provides cryptographic proof that $u_i$ has committed to threshold $k_i$.</li>\n  <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Once revealed, $u_i$ cannot deny their commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Formal Proof Sketch</h2>\n\n<p>The security of the scheme relies on the computational hardness of the underlying cryptographic primitives. We assume:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Discrete logarithm problem is hard in the chosen group $\\mathbb{G}$</li>\n  <li>Hash function $H$ is collision-resistant</li>\n  <li>Commitment scheme is computationally binding and hiding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Under these assumptions, we can prove that the scheme satisfies the security properties listed above. The full proof is omitted here but follows standard cryptographic reduction techniques.</p>"

    "description": "How anonymous credible commitments can help victims of abuse coordinate coming forward, ensuring they're not alone when they speak out.",
    "content": "<p>Harvey Weinstein's victims knew they weren't alone, but each woman feared going public without others. The first to speak out faced the full weight of his power and disbelief.</p>\n\n<h2>The Isolation Problem</h2>\n<p>Victims of abuse often know they're not alone, but fear the consequences of speaking out individually. The first person to come forward faces disbelief, legal threats, and social isolation, while the abuser uses their power to silence and discredit them.</p>\n\n<h2>Coordinated Disclosure</h2>\n<p>Anonymous credible commitments allow victims to commit to coming forward, setting their own threshold for when they're willing to be revealed. One victim might set their threshold at 5 commitments, while another might need 20. When enough victims have committed, everyone who set a threshold below that number is revealed together.</p>\n\n<h2>Strength in Unity</h2>\n<p>This approach ensures that victims are never alone when they speak out. By coordinating their disclosure, victims can overcome the power imbalance that keeps abuse hidden, transforming individual fear into collective courage.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Citizens in an authoritarian regime oppose the government but won't speak out unless they know the majority shares their views. Fear of being the only dissenter keeps everyone silent.</p>\n\n<h2>The Silence Problem</h2>\n<p>In authoritarian regimes, expressing dissent is dangerous. Individuals who speak out alone face severe consequences, while the regime benefits from the perception that opposition is minimal. This creates a coordination trap where everyone wants change but no one acts.</p>\n\n<h2>Breaking the Silence</h2>\n<p>Anonymous credible commitments allow citizens to express their opposition privately, committing to public action only when enough others have also committed. A student might set their threshold at 10,000 commitments, while a journalist might need 50,000. When the threshold is reached, all committed individuals are revealed together.</p>\n\n<h2>Safety in Numbers</h2>\n<p>This approach provides the safety in numbers that makes political change possible. Citizens can coordinate their opposition without exposing themselves to individual risk, transforming silent discontent into visible collective action.</p>"
